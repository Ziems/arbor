## üöÄ Installation

Install Arbor via pip:

```bash
pip install -U arbor-ai
```

Optionally, you can also install flash attention to speed up inference. <br/>
This can take 15+ minutes to install on some setups:

```bash
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Config

Arbor looks for a config at `~/.arbor/config.yaml` by default.

- Auto-setup (recommended): run the server once and follow prompts. It will create `~/.arbor/config.yaml`.
  ```bash
  python -m arbor.cli serve
  ```

- Manual setup: create `~/.arbor/config.yaml` with at least GPU IDs. You may omit `storage_path` to use the default (`~/.arbor/storage` locally or `/root/.arbor/storage` in Docker).

  Example:
  ```yaml
  # ~/.arbor/config.yaml
  # Optional: use absolute path; omit to use default
  # storage_path: /home/<your-user>/.arbor/storage
  inference:
    gpu_ids: [0]
  training:
    gpu_ids: [1, 2]
  ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Server

**CLI:**

```bash
python -m arbor.cli serve
```

**Docker (GPU):**

```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 7453:7453 -v ~/.arbor:/root/.arbor arbor-ai
```

- This mounts your local `~/.arbor` (which contains `config.yaml` and `storage/`) into the container at `/root/.arbor` and exposes the default port `7453`.
- If your config uses an absolute path like `/home/<user>/.arbor/storage`, either:
  - mount that same path into the container, or
  - update `storage_path` in `~/.arbor/config.yaml` to `/root/.arbor/storage`.

**Google Colab/Jupyter:**

```python
import arbor
arbor.init()  # Auto-detects GPUs, creates config, starts server in background

from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:7453/v1", api_key="not-needed")
```

### Troubleshooting

**NCCL Errors**
Certain GPU setups, particularly with newer GPUs, seem to have issues with NCCL that cause Arbor to crash. Often times of these can be fixed with the following environment variables:

```bash
export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1
export NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1
```

**NVCC**
If you run into issues, double check that you have [nvcc](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/) installed:

```bash
nvcc --version
```

If you don't have admin permissions, you can often install nvcc using conda.
